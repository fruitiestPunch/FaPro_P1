# Fachprojet "Routing Algorithms"

# Structure
Each subfolder contains the algorithmic idea of each member.

# Workflow
To work on the project, just clone the git repository.
Once cloned, you can go into each individual subfolder and work on it.

```bash
conda activate wan_sr
```
```bash
cd pathToProjectFolder/src/
```
```bash
python3 main.py
```
```bash
python3 plot_results.py "../out/"
```
